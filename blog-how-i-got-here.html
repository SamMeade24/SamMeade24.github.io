                    <p>I didn’t just want to write code.<br />
                    I wanted to build something I could truly call mine.</p>

                    <p>When I first started learning web development, I wasn’t thinking about brand strategy, voice, or identity. I was focused on understanding the basics — how HTML and CSS worked, how to make things function properly, and how to solve problems through code. It was simple, and that simplicity hooked me.</p>

                    <p>But the more I practiced, the more I realised I wanted to do more than just build functional websites — I wanted to create experiences with intention and perspective.</p>

                    <p>And eventually, I hoped to build a digital agency that reflected my own approach and values.</p>

                    <h2>From Learning to Launching</h2>
                    <p>As I worked through my learning journey, completing projects within the Codecademy syllabus and building my own site, I realized I wanted more than just isolated exercises.</p>

                    <p>I wanted every project I created — no matter how small — to be part of something bigger, something intentional that I could call my own.</p>

                    <p>The idea of building a brand that reflected my approach and values started to take shape early on, long before any professional work came into the picture.</p>

                    <p>I wanted a throughline — a signature, a reason, a “why” — running through everything I build moving forward.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why I Let Go of “Marvel Digital” and “Meade & Co.”</h2>
                    <p>When I first imagined starting a digital agency, I landed on the name Marvel Digital — a nod to my longtime love of the Marvel universe. But I quickly realised that using “Marvel” could lead to trademark and copyright issues, so I needed a different direction.</p>

                    <p>Next, I settled on Meade & Co. It sounded professional and legitimate — like a real business. But the more I looked at it, the less it felt like me. It was clean, but cold. It said “corporate” when I wanted “craft.” It implied a boardroom when really, it was just me and a lot of coffee.</p>

                    <p>So I stripped it back and asked myself:<br />
                    <strong>“What do I actually want this to be?”</strong></p>

                    <p>The answer was simple: I wanted it to be mine. Built with my hands. Thoughtfully. Deliberately. Like a maker’s mark at the bottom of a crafted object.</p>

                    <p>That’s when MadeByMeade came to life.</p>

                    <h2>A Brand That Feels Like I Do</h2>
                    <p>The brand for MadeByMeade didn’t begin with trends or templates — it began with what I love. My interests, hobbies, and passions shaped the ideas behind the brand identity: from Marvel to Arsenal, these inspirations helped guide the colours, style, and personality I wanted to bring to life.</p>

                    <p>I wanted the brand to feel personal, bold, and honest — like a conversation, not a pitch deck. Every design decision came from that foundation:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Red became the core colour</strong> — strong, confident, a little rebellious.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cream softened it</strong> — approachable, human, tactile.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navy and Gold grounded it</strong> — adding contrast, depth, and polish.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The fonts reflect this balance too:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Montserrat</strong> in the headlines gives it presence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Courier Prime</strong> in the body keeps it grounded — a nod to typewriters, storytelling, and work done with intention.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Football lovers will recognise the colour palette as a nod to the club I follow — Arsenal, the Gunners.</p>

                    <p>The logo is simple. Clean. Understated. But it’s more than just an identity — it’s a statement:<br />
                    This work is crafted. This brand has a point of view. This is MadeByMeade.</p>

                    <h2>Building Websites That Matter</h2>
                    <p>MadeByMeade isn’t just about making things look good on a screen.</p>

                    <p>It’s about building digital experiences that connect — helping small business owners feel proud to showcase their brand online.</p>

                    <p>Every line of code I write is with intention — to craft clear architecture, purposeful interactions, and meaningful structure that serve the brand’s goals.</p>

                    <p>While the brand owners choose their colours and identity, I’m here to guide and make decisions around user experience, site structure, and the technical build — creating websites that work for real people and real business needs.</p>

                    <p>Every detail — from micro-interactions to navigation — is chosen with care. Nothing is filler or off-the-shelf.</p>

                    <p>Whether it’s a portfolio, a startup site, or a digital story, the work is always designed to reflect the person or idea behind it, built with care and craft.</p>

                    <p>That’s why the straplines I landed on aren’t just catchy phrases — they’re promises:<br />
                    <strong>Crafted with code. Made by Meade.<br />
                    Built for impact. Made by Meade.<br />

                    <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
                    <p>This blog will be the space where I take you behind the curtain — sharing the process, the technical choices, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>

                    <p>I’ll cover project breakdowns, coding tips, the latest development trends, and insights into building effective, reliable websites.</p>

                    <p>I’ll also touch on styles and brand identities that inspire me, especially how good design supports strong development.</p>

                    <p>My hope is that this space helps, informs, and maybe even sparks some ideas for your own projects.</p>
